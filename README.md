# Air-Quality-Prediction-with-MICE-Bootstrapping-Elastic-Net-Regression-R

This project aims to amplify the importance of effective modeling using data impuation techniques. MICE imputations were used and bootstrapping was performed to estimate the bias and variability to select the best imputed dataset and finally, Elastic-Net regression was applied to obtain the results.
